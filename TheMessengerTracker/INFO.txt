Jacksonbird8237's Messenger Item Tracker
(based off crossproduct's alttp tracker)


How to use:
run the html file. it will open in a browser window.
(note: idk what scaling whould look good so right now i only have one settign for that let me know if you want it displayed smaller)
left click the item icons to show that you have obtained it.
Candle will go: no candle -> candle -> seeds -> candle+seeds -> leaves -> candle_leaves -> no candle

I will be adding item locations which will tell you what items are in logic in a future update.
Please let me know of any bugs :P
