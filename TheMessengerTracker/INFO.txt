Jacksonbird8237's Messenger Item Tracker
(based off crossproduct's alttp tracker)


How to use:
run the html file. it will open in a browser window.
(note: idk what scaling whould look good so right now i only have one setting for that let me know if you want it displayed smaller or bigger etc)
left click the item icons to show that you have obtained it.
Candle will go: no candle -> candle -> seeds -> candle+seeds -> leaves -> candle+leaves -> no candle

you can click the squares on the map to show that you got that item location. mouse over the location to see what it corresponds to. 
GREEN = obtainable in logic
YELLOW = obtainable out of logic
RED = unobtainable
GRAY = checked

Edit 10/29/20: I added seals which are the circle checks on the map. Currently there is no logic for them so they will all appear green even if you can't get them yet. I will edit this when I add logic. If you want the seals to appear hit the "adavnced" button at the bottom. You can hit the "Normal" button to switch back.

Please let me know of any bugs :P
